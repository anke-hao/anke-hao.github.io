                    <h1><b>Gender-Likability IAT</b></h1>
                    <p class = "big">The <b><a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/iatdetails.html">Implicit Association Test (IAT)</a></b> is a generalized methodology used for testing implicit bias in general, and the most famous instance of it is the Race IAT. I created my own version, Gender-Likability (IAT), as a reaction-time experiment to test for implicit gender bias in professional settings. 
                        <br><br>
                        I set out to discover whether implicit bias was involved in how women are described differently (and often more negatively) than men in professional settings. I surveyed over 300 participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk, using the standard IAT methodology for measuring participant reaction times. I used the <b><a href="https://www.psytoolkit.org/">Psytoolkit platform</a></b> to code an interactive experiment that recorded reaction times of the participants, and I learned the custom scripting language for the platform and built the experiment from scratch within a week. 
                        <br><br>
                        The participants were presented with stimuli like the ones displayed below, and were asked to press keys in accordance with which side had the correct gender- or characteristic-associated word.

                    <p class = "big">The experiment results showed that the average reaction times of the participants do not conclusively favor one condition over the other (linking positive characteristics with male-associated words and female-associated words with negative characteristics, or vice versa). There are several factors that may contribute to this, including a high proportion of female participants (60% over the 50.8% in the population) and over half of the participants belonging to the Millenial or Gen Z populations, which are known for more liberal and progressive viewpoints (Parker et al., 2020) (The Generation Gap in American Politics, 2019).

                    I won my class’s Big Data competition for the topic I chose, the methodologies I implemented, and my discussion of the results’ implications and future steps.
